# CSV Cheatsheet
#
# 
# Format Details and defaults when not set 
# 
# Type:         action (A), AJAX action (XA) or static content (S), defaults to A (optional)
# Name:         the name of the action (defaults to Action-<recordNumber>) (optional)
# URL:			an URL (mandatory)
# Method:		which method of GET or POST, defaults to GET
# Parameters:	which parameters to send, when GET, these can be already part of the URL, 
#               no default values (optional)
# ResponseCode:	which HTTP response code is expected, defaults to 200 (optional)
# XPath:		XPath for validation (none)
# RegExp:		regexp for validation (none)
# Text:			Text(Pattern) for validation against the XPath/RegExp result or just searched on the page,
#               no default text (optional) 
# Encoded:		whether or not URL and parameters are already encoded, defaults to false (optional) 
#
# Comments and empty lines are permitted. Header lines have to be valid. Additional header lines
# are not permitted as well as the spelling has to match including upper/lower-casing.
#
# Additional placeholders give you the ability to insert random data into the lines. The columns
# URL, Parameters, XPath, Text, and RegExp support it.
#
# ${NOW} : Current timestamp in milliseconds
# ${RANDOM.String(x)} : a random string with length x. Contains [A-Za-z].   
# ${RANDOM.String(x, s)} : a random string with length x. Contains characters from s.   
# ${RANDOM.Number(max)} : returns an integer between 0 (inclusive) and max (inclusive)   
# ${RANDOM.Number(min, max)} : returns an integer between min (inclusive) and max (inclusive)   
# ${foobar} : Looks up the property foobar from the properties. Normal fallback mode. 
#
# Additionally, you can use DATA which is an instance of the GeneralDataProvider. So things like
# ${DATA.getStreet(false)} or ${DATA.getTrulyUniqueEmail("xyzqtar987654.com")} will work.
# You can basically write a lot into this command, because it is a beanshell command. 
#
# A special feature are columns, that start with xpath. You can get any data from the page using
# these. They will end up in variables with the same name as the column and can be used in any expression later on.
#
# When running the light weight based test, instead of using xpath, you should consider regexp. regexp works the same way as xpath.
#
# The interpretation of ${something} starts with a lookup in the variable storage. Then, it looks into the properties. If no property is
# found, the beanshell interpretation will try to make sense of the variable.
